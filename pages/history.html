            <h1 class="history-title">HISTORY of Kunitachi</h1>
            <p class="history-text">
                Once upon a time, there was a village called Yaho that thrived with rice farming
                and agriculture due to its suitable soil for paddy fields. In 1889, Yaho Village,
                Aoyagi Village, and Ishida Village Enclave merged to become "Yaho Village,"
                the predecessor of the city of Kunitachi.
            </p>
            <p class="history-text">
                In the late Taisho period, the northern part of the village, which was originally
                forested, underwent development by the Hakone Land Company. Aimed at creating an
                "ideal cultural and educational city," the transformation began with the relocation
                of Kunitachi Music University and the opening of Kokuritsu Station in 1926,
                followed by the relocation of Hitotsubashi University in 1927. The opening of
                Kunitachi Station saw the construction of the distinctive "Former Kunitachi Station"
                with its red triangular roof and white walls. In 1934, cherry trees were planted
                along the University Street to commemorate the birth of the Crown Prince in 1933.
            </p>
            <p class="history-text">
                Subsequently, the population continued to grow, and in 1951, Yaho Village became
                Kunitachi Town. Around that time, a movement called the "Designation of the Cultural
                and Educational District" emerged, led by citizens and students, resulting in the
                district's designation in 1952. In 1965, the population exceeded 50,000, and in 1967,
                "Kunitachi City" was born.
            </p>
            <p class="history-text">
                By the way, the Former Kunitachi Station was dismantled in 2006 during the elevation
                work on the JR Chuo Line. It served as a station building for 80 years and was mourned
                by many citizens. However, in 2020, it was rebuilt to its original appearance and
                transformed into a public facility. It consists of not only a historic preservation
                area but also a "History Exhibition Room," "Tourist Information Center," and versatile
                spaces such as meeting, resting, and event areas in the "Hall" and "Outdoor Space."
