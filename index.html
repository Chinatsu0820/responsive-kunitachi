        <h1 class="home-title">What is Kunitachi like?</h1>
        <p class="home-text">
            Kunitachi City is located in the central part of Tokyo, Japan. It borders Fuchu City to
            the east, Tachikawa City to the west, Kokubunji City to the north, and Hino City across
            the Tama River to the south. It is the second smallest city in Tokyo and the fourth smallest
            city in Japan.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            Despite being a small city, Kunitachi has many attractions.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            As the first designated cultural and educational district in Tokyo, Kunitachi is home to
            numerous educational institutions such as universities and high schools. During the daytime,
            the city is vibrant with many students, but there are regulations on the construction of
            facilities that may impact education, giving the entire city a calm atmosphere. The main
            street of the city, known as Daigaku-dori, and its surrounding area are filled with trendy
            shops and restaurants, making it an enjoyable place to stroll around. When visiting
            Kunitachi, be sure to explore the unique shops scattered throughout the city and enjoy shopping.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            Daigaku-dori, which extends straight south from JR Kunitachi Station, is the city's main
            street and is approximately 44 meters wide. Currently, cherry trees and gingko trees are
            planted alternately along the green belts on both sides of the road. In spring, the cherry
            blossoms create a curtain of pink petals, while in autumn, the golden leaves of the gingko
            trees radiate a brilliant glow. This scenery has been selected as one of the "New Tokyo Top
            100 Views" and has become a symbol of Kunitachi.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            If you want to experience a different side of Kunitachi, take a walk southward along
            Daigaku-dori and enjoy exploring the green and rural areas in the southern part of the city.
            It is a place where you can witness another charm of Kunitachi that is completely different
            from the main street.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            Such a dual charm harmonizes within the compact space of 8.15 square kilometers. I encourage
            all of you to visit this city, filled with greenery and distinctive characteristics, at least
            once.
        </p>
