This is a final assignment on the first term of Web develper course in Tamwood.
The primary goal of this assignment is to understand css box model and layout behaviors such as flexbox.

This website introduces my country.
I am from Tokyo, Japan.
I was born in Suginami-ku, but I grew up in Kunitachi-shi <国立市> (Both are in Tokyo).
Therefore I chose Kunitachi-shi to make the website. 


I have to create 5pages, and each of these pages must replicate the layouts provided by the teacher. 
All the pages should have a nav and a footer, both of which should be Flex containers.

event.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block, and contains two other Block elements inside it

index.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block, and is styled to showcase the CSS Box Model

history.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block, and has another Block inside with a Floated element inside it and other content wrapping around it. The Floated element should be Floated to the left.

kuninyan.html
 -Another page like the one above, but whose Float is Floated to the right.

spot.html
 -A page whose main section is a Flex container, which contains two Flex containers; the first one has flex-direction set to column, and the second one to the default of rows, with rows wrapping.


Another important requirement taken into account for grading:
 -Add simple and concise comment lines in my HTML and CSS to indicate where each page section / container starts, and provide some description of how it is behaving (block, float, flex container, or flex item) 
 -Make sure my HTML is properly indented so it is easy to identify each section / element

I can style my web pages however I like, and I can add whatever theme / content I like. Feel free to repeat themes and content from my previous assignments if I want.
