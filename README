This is a second assignment remaking the final assignment on the first term of Web develper course in Tamwood.
The primary goal of this assignment is to using and understand all of the things I learned like Flexbox, Grid, CSS units, media queries, responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop) etc.

This website introduces my country.
I am from Tokyo, Japan.
I was born in Suginami-ku, but I grew up in Kunitachi-shi <国立市> (Both are in Tokyo).
Therefore I chose Kunitachi-shi to make the website. 

I have 5pages, all of the pages should have a nav and a footer.

event.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block

index.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block, and is styled to showcase the CSS Box Model

history.html
 -A page whose main section is a Block, and has another Block inside with a Floated element inside it and other content wrapping around it. The Floated element should be Floated to the left.

kuninyan.html
 -A page whose main section is a Grid. This page was Float-Right page before.

spot.html
 -A page whose main section is a Flex container, which contains two Flex containers; the first one has flex-direction set to column, and the second one to the default of rows, with rows wrapping.


Another important requirement taken into account for grading:
 -Add simple and concise comment lines in my HTML and CSS to indicate where each page section / container starts, and provide some description of how it is behaving (block, float, flex container, flex item, or Grid) .
 -Make sure my HTML is properly indented so it is easy to identify each section / element

I can style my web pages however I like, and I can add whatever theme / content I like. Feel free to repeat themes and content from my previous assignments if I want.
